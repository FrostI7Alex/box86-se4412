box86 (0.3.4) unstable; urgency=low

 * X86Libs: Updated libstdc++ & libgcc_s
 * X86Libs: Use x86 vrsion of libunwind (it's needed by wine)
 * Dynarec: Fixed some flags propagation issues inside blocks
 * Dynarec: Improved Strong Memory Model emulation, introducing a 3rd level
 * CPU: Remoworked how INT, priviliged opcodes and teh Trace flags works
 * CPU: Added full support for SSE4.2
 * ElfLoader: rework how elf memory is handled
 * Emulation: Better handling of Signal (also handling SIGMAX correctly)
 * Emulation: Better support for POKEUSER/PEEKUSER (helps Windows Unity games)
 * Wrapping: More libs and some fixes in function wrapping (gtk3, vulkan...)
 * Wrapping: Removed faked libunwind wrapping
 * Hardware: Added more profile, with support for ADLink Ampere Altra
 * OS: Added profile to build for Android and Termux.
 * => Mostly a stability update with improved elfloader again, and added SSE 4.2 support (still need to work on the Dynarec part of this)
 * => Some work also to reduce the memory footprint

box86 (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

 * Added rcfile handling: box86 now read "/etc/box86.box86rc" and "~/.box86rc" and apply per process parameters
 * Added BOX86_DYNAREC_FORWARD to allow bigger Dynarec block to be build
 * Refactored Strong Memory Model emulation (faster and more accurate)
 * Box86 now return a custom name for the CPU instal of P4, build with Box86 and the cpu name it's running on
 * Improved memory protection tracking and signal handling, again
 * More wrapped libs (especially on the gtk familly)
 * More wrapped functions
 * Added support for CreateDeviceEx in d3dadapter9, for better gallium nine support
 * Improved dladdr/dladdr1 wrapped function
 * Some fixes to flags handling in the Dynarec on some special cases
 * Added specific suppport for RK3588 board (needed some hack in signal handling, probably due to the use of a non mainlined kernel)
 * Lots of improvment in the Rounding of float & double (Dynarec and Interpretor), and proper handling of denormals when converting to/from 80 bits long double
 * Added specific suppport for RK3588 board (needed some hack in signal handling, probably due to the use of a non mainlined kernel)
